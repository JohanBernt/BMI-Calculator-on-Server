# BMI-Calculator-on-Server
This is a simple calculator and a BMI Calculator running on a local server. 
Technologies used were git bash (command line) and atom to write the code for these calculators.
This code was written in atom and runs in a chrome browser using localhost:3000. I have npm, nodemon and express.js installed to ensure the code runs correctly.
